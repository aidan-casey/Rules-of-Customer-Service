# [WIP] Aidan's Rules of Customer Service

Aidan is a particular person with opinions on how everything should be done. This repository is not for the faint of heart, tread carefully my friend.

Below you will find a compilation of my opinions on customer service "best practices". Please feel free to comment or contribute!

* [1. Customer Contact](#1._customer_contact)

## 1. Customer Contact

To solve a problem, you must first be aware of it. This is where customer contact comes into play.

### 1.1 Customer First, Problem Second

An important problem may occur, but the customer is still important. Ask them how they are, then determine how you can help and make their day a little bit better.

### 1.2 The Fifteen Minute Rule

Fifteen minutes is too long period.

No one likes sitting on the phone. Especially when the guy on the other side of the line is deep in thought trying to fix your problem and not very talkative. Get the info you need and get them off the phone while you work the problem. If you need something further or you have a solution, a simple phone call or email shouldn't be that hard to get out to them.

At the same time, no one likes wondering if their email actually reached support. Did they get my plea for help? Do they care? Are they working on it? Get a response out to the customer within fifteen minutes of see a new email come in.
